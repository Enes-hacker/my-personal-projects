                    <h1>2. Home Alone </h1>
                    <p><span>H</span>ome Alone is a series of American Christmas family comedy films originally created by John Hughes, and
                         directed by Chris Columbus, Raja Gosnell, Rod Daniel, Peter Hewitt, and Dan Mazer. 
                        The films revolve around the adventures surrounding children who find themselves alone during the holiday season
                         and are faced with the challenge of
                         defending their family's house or themselves from invading burglars and criminals.
                        The first three films were released theatrically by 20th Century Fox, while the following two
                         made-for-television films were produced by Fox Television Studios, aired on the Disney-owned ABC. 
                         Following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, a sixth film in the franchise was produced
                          by the newly renamed 20th Century Studios for the Disney-owned streaming service Disney+.
                         Also, an R-rated seventh film, intended to be directed by Augustine Frizzell, entered development hell. </p>

                         Prayers for George are heard in heaven, and Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), a second-class angel who has yet 
                         to earn his wings, is tasked with saving him. First, however, he is shown highlights of George’s life in the small
                          town of Bedford Falls. Through a number of acts beginning in childhood, George is revealed as selfless and kindhearted. 
                          After the death of his father, George sets aside his dreams of traveling the world in order to run his family’s savings and loan business.
                         His decision earns the enmity of greedy banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who is determined to close the business.</p>
